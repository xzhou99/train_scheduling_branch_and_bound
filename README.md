# train_scheduling_branch_and_bound
Source code for branch and bound based train timetabling algorithms, for paper titled: Single-track train timetabling with guaranteed optimality: Branch-and-bound algorithms with enhanced lower bounds

Simple instructions:

1. How to generate an optimal timetable
menu -> compute -> compute -> computer button
show optimial -> show final optimal table

notes: train size downstream, upstream

2. View structure
right view -> branch-and-bound tree, where the white line means the
node is dominated.
left view -> timetable

3. View timetable at each node
toolbar -> T button -> train list

If there is a "x" sign before node number, it means the node is dominated.
